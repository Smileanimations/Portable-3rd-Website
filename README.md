# Portable 3rd Website


!! USE APACHE AND MYSQL TO ACTUALLY MAKE THIS SITE FUNCTION !!
!! BIG CHANCE YOU HAVE TO CHANGE THE USERNAME AND PASSWORD ON A LOT OF STUFF, STILL FIGURING SOME THINGS OUT!!
!! ALSO MAKE SURE TO IMPORT THE .SQL FILE !!

A school project turned passion project.
I am probably going to make small edits on this site, but not all that much so yeah go have fun and explore the site.

Pictures and some descriptions are from the [https://monsterhunter.fandom.com/wiki/Monster_Hunter_Wiki] their gallery was very helpful and saved me a lot of time.

(small chance nothing works becauses i do not know github)
